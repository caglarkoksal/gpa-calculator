# GPA Calculator

A simple web tool to calculate your average GPA based on inputted grades and credits for different academic years. This tool supports two programs: `PRE` and `MPlan/MPRE`. It allows you to enter your grades and credits for each module and calculates the final GPA, weighted by the yearâ€™s contribution to the overall grade.

## Implementation

The GPA Calculator was developed with the help of OpenAI's ChatGPT. ChatGPT guided the design of the HTML layout and code functionality, ensuring ease of use and flexibility in calculating the GPA across different academic years.

## How to Use

1. **Select your program**:
    - Choose between `PRE` or `MPlan/MPRE`.
2. **Enter your grades and credits**:
    - For each year, enter the grades (0-100) and credits (0-40) for each module. Only valid entries will be considered.
    - You do not need to fill in all module boxes.
3. **Click "Calculate GPA"**:
    - Your final GPA will be displayed, and any issues with the credit totals (if less than or more than 120 per year) will show a warning.
4. **Correct any errors** if prompted and re-calculate if needed.
